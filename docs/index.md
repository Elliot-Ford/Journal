# Welcome! 
Thanks for checking my journal out! The goal of this is to help capture some of the projects I have worked/am working on (both digital and physical) and things that I've been playing around with. A lot of this is very much a work in progress so I apologize in advance for the mess. If you want to know more about who I am and how you can reach me, you can check out the [About](about) page.
